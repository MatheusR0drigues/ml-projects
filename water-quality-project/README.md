<h1>Water Quality Machine Learning Project</h1>

Data set from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability.

<h3>Context</h2>
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<al>
  <li>There are low correlation coefficients between the features.
  <li>Random Forest was the best model.
  <li>The average accuracy between the DummyClassifier and the best model (RandomForest) was only 5.07%.
